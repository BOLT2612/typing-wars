# typing-wars

This is a repo to try out some ideas for a typing game.

The general idea is to get people to learn to touch type, instead of hunting and pecking.  
If two or more people can challenge each other to "who's the best touch typist" perhaps a 
few lunches or rounds of drinks could be at stake.  Some friends might really get into it.

However the main idea is to give children a reason to learn to touch typing at an early age.
Who doesn't like winning!
